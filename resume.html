		<p/>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name's Nathan and I am in computer science. I started working on my computer science degree after becoming an IT assistant and I actually started to enjoy what I was doing. I knew if I wanted to pursue a field with computers, having a degree would help me a lot. Since starting on my degree, I've been enjoying programming and working with Java. I also have experience in C++, python, and SQL.</p>
