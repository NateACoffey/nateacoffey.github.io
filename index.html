    <p/>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name's Nathan and I am in computer science. I started working on my computer science degree after becoming an IT assistant and I really enjoyed it. I knew that if I wanted to purpose a field in computer, having a degree would help a lot. I've been enjoying programming and working with Java. I also have experience in C++, python, and SQL.</p>
