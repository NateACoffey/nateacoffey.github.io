		<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
		<p>My name is Nathan Coffey, and I'm passionate about exploring the worlds of software engineering, music, and gardening. As an aspiring software engineer, I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in the field. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing guitar, tending to my plants, or hitting the gym. I believe that a well-rounded life is the key to success, and I'm always striving to strike the perfect balance between work and play. Join me as I share my experiences and insights on my journey to becoming a successful software engineer.</p>
