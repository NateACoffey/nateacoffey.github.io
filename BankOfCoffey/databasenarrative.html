		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, I wanted to just store everything in a hashed array but the requirement of using a database changed that plan immediately. I’ve dabbled with Java communicating with a database before but unsuccessfully; I thought this would be good practice if I ever needed to set another up. I don’t know how popular Microsoft Access is in the real world but I assume using Java to communicate with a database would be very similar. It even shows off that I can use SQL and how to handle CRUD operations. A big way this is better than using an array is that a database can be in a centrally located area with all information whereas an array would be client dependent. Even though my bank application is just a mock bank, the real world would use something more reliable and reusable. Communicating with a database would be a more transferable and impressive skill than accessing values in an array.</p>
		
		<p><strong>"Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage pl  ans"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did meet my objective that I planned out. I think out of all the requirements, the database portion was the easiest and most straightforward. All I needed was a database and a way to communicate with said database using CRUThe database section is a Microsoft Access database that holds my bank application’s users. I’ve never made my own database, only used databases that were setup through Codio. I wanted an easy way to be able to have the database information and be able to communicate with Java. I looked if Office had a database and a bit of research showed that there were a fair amount of people that used Access. I knew that if I had trouble, I could Google problems and would likely find solutions.D operations. Right now, the database requires the file location so after I finish the application, I will look into handling a missing file location. Hopefully I can do like most applications where it pulls up a file explorer to identify where the database file is located.</p>
		
		<p><strong>"Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a decent amount of troubles communicating with the database. Apparently, things changed with Java SE7 so using SE8 made things trickier since a lot of the suggestions were no longer applicable. Also, Microsoft Access has two different database extensions so some of the things the worked with the MDB format didn’t necessarily work with ACCDB format. A couple hours of research was required but once I got the right words to describe my problem, I managed to gear my searches closer to what I needed. I did learn that it was complicated and a bit of work but once I got it to work, everything was very smooth. I had to install some jar files to get things to work. I could have tried Maven but I’ve only tried using Maven once and it failed miserably. I also learned how to handle SQL commands with Java. If I ever use Java with SQL in my future career then I will have a much better understanding on how to be successful. Maybe I didn’t do everything perfectly as working with ResultSet seemed very odd but just having the experience will allow me to learn faster.</p>
