		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My computer science degree has taught me a lot of things that will help my professional career. I took a class on Agile software development life cycle which taught me how developing software works and how to communicate with other members on a team. Agile shows the benefit of working as a team to develop multiple, smaller iterations of a project as opposed to management handing a project down the line until the last team, creating the final project. It taught the importance of keeping communication with everyone, from developers and testers to product owner. The class also showed that there are many other methodologies besides agile that can be used. Some projects may not work with the agile method and that’s okay. Another class was dedicated to data structures and algorithms. I really enjoyed this class because it was difficult and really showed that sometimes, things were a lot more simple than I tried to make them. Learning the various data structures like stacks, linked lists, trees, and of course arrays seem like something that will be invaluable for my entire developer career. Learning various algorithms showed me that there are multiple ways to do one thing. Some algorithms are better for inserting but at the same time might not be good at deleting. Others might be good at searching in a massive data structure but very poor in a small structure. Another class was object oriented design and analysis which showed me that there are many steps that can be done prior to developing that will make developing significantly easier. Making UML diagrams like various behavioral and structural diagrams. This allows you to understand how to code a project since things like classes and use cases are all thought about how they relate to each other. This means you just have to do the actually coding. The last class that I think will help me greatly was about secure coding. The biggest thing I learned from this was to follow best coding practices at all times and to take code reviews seriously. Bugs that were in the real world could have been easily caught if they were properly reviewed and some would have made a bug irrelevant if they just kept to coding standards. A lot of the mistakes that people make are either from lazily coding or code reviews not being serious. The class also introduced me to static analysis tools. This can search your code for common bugs that occur with the programming language you use such as integer overflows, string buffer overflows, or null pointers. This would be more difficult for someone to catch without specifically testing for it.<br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My project is a good showcase for my skills for my ePortfolio because it shows that I have an understanding on various subjects within programming. It shows my ability to use software design with making an activity diagram and a use case diagram. This made making my bank program a lot easier because it gave me a basic understand of how I wanted to code my program. I could even code sections of my program while I researched how to make other parts of my program work. Getting hung up on part of my program didn’t completely stop me from programming the classes I did know how. It also shows that my knowledge of algorithms and how to code them for things beyond regular arrays. I used the normal algorithms and changed them so I could sort by various variables in an object array. This shows that my knowledge of algorithms is good enough to alter them depending on how I need to use them. My program also shows that I can communicate with a database. I used Microsoft Access which may not be a popular way to organize a database but it shows a proof of concept that I can work with what I have. After a lot of research, I was able to communicate with the database even after java and MS Access had gone through major updates changing how they can communicate with each other. I had a big problem of communicating and was holding up a big portion of my project but I was able to persevere and was finally able to get everything to work. I feel like I’ve learned a lot and I know that I have even more to learn.</p>

		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My artifact is a bank application. It simulates an actual bank with the same features such as creating an account, withdraw, deposit, transfer, etc. My program uses a database to store its users. It stores information about the user as well as credentials. It also has an admin log in to query various information about the users such as state, zip code, and amount of accounts. This can be used to show where people are using the bank application the most. I had this idea a bit before the class because I wanted to put something on my GitHub account. The requirements of the class really pushed my original idea and had to implement a database and data structure/algorithm. I was originally planning on putting the information into a hashed array using the username. It might have been easier but I’m learning more and having to be creative. </p>

		<h2 align="center">Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
		
		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the algorithms & data structure, I’ve have constructed an admin login to sort certain database fields. When you log into the program as the admin, the program selects five fields for the entire database, skips the admin values, and puts them into an arraylist. The GUI has two choice boxes for the field to sort by as well as the type of sort to initiate. It takes the arraylist, copies them to an array, and then sorts the array depending on the sort and field. My original idea was to just do an insertion sort to sort the fields but I felt like this was very lackluster. Eventually, I just started on the program and had that as my plan A. Once I got to actually coding the algorithm, I felt like it would be cool to have different algorithms. I decided to implement four different algorithms that you could choose and even added a timer to display the time it took to sort the array.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Database</h2>
		
		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
    		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database section is a Microsoft Access database that holds my bank application’s users. I’ve never made my own database, only used databases that were setup through Codio. I wanted an easy way to be able to have the database information and be able to communicate with Java. I looked if Office had a database and a bit of research showed that there were a fair amount of people that used Access. I knew that if I had trouble, I could Google problems and would likely find solutions.</p>
