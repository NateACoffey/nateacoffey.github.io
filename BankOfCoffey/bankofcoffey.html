		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My artifact is a bank application. It simulates an actual bank with the same features such as creating an account, withdraw, deposit, transfer, etc. My program uses a database to store its users. It stores information about the user as well as credentials. It also has an admin log in to query various information about the users such as state, zip code, and amount of accounts. This can be used to show where people are using the bank application the most. I had this idea a bit before the class because I wanted to put something on my GitHub account. The requirements of the class really pushed my original idea and had to implement a database and data structure/algorithm. I was originally planning on putting the information into a hashed array using the username. It might have been easier but I’m learning more and having to be creative. </p>

		<h2 align="center">Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
		
		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the algorithms & data structure, I’ve have constructed an admin login to sort certain database fields. When you log into the program as the admin, the program selects five fields for the entire database, skips the admin values, and puts them into an arraylist. The GUI has two choice boxes for the field to sort by as well as the type of sort to initiate. It takes the arraylist, copies them to an array, and then sorts the array depending on the sort and field. My original idea was to just do an insertion sort to sort the fields but I felt like this was very lackluster. Eventually, I just started on the program and had that as my plan A. Once I got to actually coding the algorithm, I felt like it would be cool to have different algorithms. I decided to implement four different algorithms that you could choose and even added a timer to display the time it took to sort the array.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Database</h2>
		
		<p><strong>"Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?"</strong></p>
    		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database section is a Microsoft Access database that holds my bank application’s users. I’ve never made my own database, only used databases that were setup through Codio. I wanted an easy way to be able to have the database information and be able to communicate with Java. I looked if Office had a database and a bit of research showed that there were a fair amount of people that used Access. I knew that if I had trouble, I could Google problems and would likely find solutions.</p>
