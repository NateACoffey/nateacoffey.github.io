		<h2>Bank of Coffey</h2>
		<p>For my university capstone project, I developed an efficient banking application in Java, leveraging JavaFX for the GUI and implementing serialization to store and manage account data. This project was to showcase what I've learned in software design, algorithms, and database communication.</p>

		<h2>Conjugation Practice</h2>
		<p>A project that focuses on helping users practice Japanese verb conjugations through a web application. This is the one I am most excited about. I've been enjoying learning Japanese since it's pretty challenging and a lot of fun. I wanted to make a program that would help me with the conjugation since it's pretty straightforward in most languages. Instead of using flashcards trying to memorize all the conjugations, I wanted to put them into action and see if I can remember the various inflections and the verb stem variations.</p>

		<h2>Pokedex</h2>
		<p>A desktop application utilizing JavaFX and implementing a CSV file to store Pokemon data in a comma-separated format. One of my earliest projects. I wanted to learn how to use JavaFX so my programs would have a GUI. You can scroll through the list of Pokemon (not updated past SwSh) or you can search for pokemon.</p>

		<h2>Dining Review</h2>
		<p>A restaurant review application in Java, utilizing Spring Boot and RESTful API to enable seamless communication with an embedded database. This was a combination of learning Spring/Spring Boot and implementing a RESTful api that I've learned before. This was a fairly fun project despite not implementing an actually GUI. I really enjoyed making this one especially since I learned a lot about how web requests work and how they're much more involved than I realised.</p>
